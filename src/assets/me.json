            "abstract": "A significant phenomenon in microblogging is that certain occurrences of terms self-produce increasing mentions in the unfolding event. In contrast, other terms manifest a spike for each moment of interest, resulting in a wake-up-and-sleep dynamic. Since spike morphology and background vary widely between events, to detect spikes in microblogs is a challenge. Another way is to detect the spikiness feature rather than spikes. We present an approach which detects and aggregates spikiness contributions by combination of spike patterns, called archetypes. The soft similarity between each archetype and the time series of term occurrences is based on computational stigmergy, a bio-inspired scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. Archetypes are arranged into an architectural module called Stigmergic Receptive Field (SRF). The final spikiness indicator is computed through linear combination of SRFs, whose weights are determined with the Least Square Error minimization on a spikiness training set. The structural parameters of the SRFs are instead determined with the Differential Evolution algorithm, minimizing the error on a training set of archetypal series. Experimental studies have generated a spikiness indicator in a real-world scenario. The indicator has enhanced a cloud representation of social discussion topics, where the more spiky cloud terms are more blurred."

In this paper, a novel architecture that employs stigmergy is proposed. Computational stigmergy is used to dynamically increase (or decrease) the strength of a connection, or the activation level, of an artificial neuron when stimulated (or released). This study lays down a basic framework for the derivation of a stigmergic NN with a related training algorithm. To show its potential, some pilot experiments have been reported. The XOR problem is solved by using only one single stigmergic neuron with one input and one output. A static NN, a stigmergic NN, a recurrent NN and a long short-term memory NN have been trained to solve the MNIST digits recognition benchmark."

            "abstract": "In this paper, a novel architecture of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is designed and experimented. The proposed RNN adopts a computational memory based on the concept of stigmergy. The basic principle of a Stigmergic Memory (SM) is that the activity of deposit/removal of a quantity in the SM stimulates the next activities of deposit/removal. Accordingly, subsequent SM activities tend to reinforce/weaken each other, generating a coherent coordination between the SM activities and the input temporal stimulus. We show that, in a problem of supervised classification, the SM encodes the temporal input in an emergent representational model, by coordinating the deposit, removal and classification activities. This study lays down a basic framework for the derivation of a SM-RNN. A formal ontology of SM is discussed, and the SM-RNN architecture is detailed. To appreciate the computational power of an SM-RNN, comparative NNs have been selected and trained to solve the MNIST handwritten digits recognition benchmark in its two variants: spatial (sequences of bitmap rows) and temporal (sequences of pen strokes)."
